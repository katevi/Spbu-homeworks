# Desription of the avl-tree, which implements interface collection

*Solution contains*:

 

* **BalanceTree** - class, which implements interface collection and concludes methods, which could be find here [https://metanit.com/java/tutorial/5.1.php].
* **Node** - class, which implements quantity of tree vertex and concludes methods of :
	* balancing tree ( updateHeight(), balance(), rotateRight(), rotateLeft(),balanceFactor()). Algorithm of balancing could be found here[https://grokonez.com/java/balanced-tree-avl-tree-java].
	* standart methods of working with BinaryTree (addNode(), isContainsNode(), removeNode()). Algorithm might be found here [https://www.baeldung.com/java-binary-tree].
	* setters and getters
* **BalanceTreeIterator** - class, which implements collection iterator on avl-tree and concludes methods:
	* hasNext() - checks if there is next element in collection
	* next() - returns value of the next collection element



Also solution contains tests for the BalanceTree (collection methods), BalanceTreeIterator and Node.
